## BARCLAYS 'TAKE HOME CODING TEST' API SERVICE APPLICATION 

### TODO:

* Finish User Controller Tests
* Implement Account and Transaction Controller Tests
* Implement Reference field population on Transaction ?
* Field validation is handled by 'org.openapitools' generated schemas.
Perhaps some further spring based validation should be implemented?
